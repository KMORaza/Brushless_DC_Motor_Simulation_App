This software simulates a brushless DC motor and I wrote this software in C# programming language. This software is a robust tool for simulation of brushless DC motor yet it can be said that development of this software is still in progress because I have in mind some more features which I might integrate into it whenever my schedule allows. 
So I'll write enhanced version of this software when I'll get enough time but I ain't sure about when I'll get sufficient time. 

*Update*:- Since I wanted to improve this software, I have incorporated some of the features.
